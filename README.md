# COVID-Mask-Detector
By Thomas Huitema

## Introduction
One of the largest struggles of the COVID-19 pandemic is the enforcement of mask mandates imposed by state and local leaders. Many businesses have had to change employees' roles to just enforcing mask-wearing. In some cases, businesses have even hired employees to do this simple task. With a mask detector, this problem could be solved. Instead of employees spending their shifts watching people as they come in to see if they are wearing masks, they could be doing more meaningful work instead. The detector I'm developing will use a camera to detect if people are wearing masks or not. If they aren't wearing a mask, an alert will be sent to the user

## Goals
- Detect faces and check if they are wearing masks
- Alert user if someone without a mask is detected
- Alert the user through a text or alarm
